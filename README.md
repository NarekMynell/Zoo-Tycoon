# ü¶ì Zoo Tycoon Idle (Unity 2022.3.37f1)

A low-poly 3D idle tycoon game prototype built in Unity. The player manages a zoo-style business empire, upgrading various facilities to increase revenue over time. The project showcases core gameplay systems, custom UI, saving/loading, and scene management using native Unity tools only.
